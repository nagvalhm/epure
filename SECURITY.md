# Security Policy

Security is very important for Epure and its community. ðŸ”’

Learn more about it below. ðŸ‘‡

## Versions

The latest version of Epure is supported.

You are encouraged to write tests for your application and update your Epure version frequently after ensuring that your tests are passing. This way you will benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, and **security fixes**.

You can learn more about Epure versions and how to pin and upgrade them for your project in the docs.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please report it right away by sending an email to: epurepy@gmail.com. Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.

## Public Discussions

Please restrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability. ðŸ™Š

It's better to discuss privately and try to find a solution first, to limit the potential impact as much as possible.
